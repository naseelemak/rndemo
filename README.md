A no-frills, sorta lightweight app that keeps you focused on your main goalâ€”finding movies with the word "car" in their titles.

## Main Features
- Pseudo-authentication
- Persistant logins

### Remarks: 
- This was only tested on iOS simulator
- Chose to go with the "`flow` + generator function" method for handling API calls because it seemed to be the most similar method to `redux-saga` implementation which I am already familiar with
- The styling for the movie list was heavily inspired by my work in https://github.com/naseelemak/jithub
- Please feel free to contact me if there are any questions on the implementation decisions
